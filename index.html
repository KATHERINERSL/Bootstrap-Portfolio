            <p>Their really isn't much to know about me. I was born and raised in Ocala,Fl where I currently reside. 
                I am the only girl of 4 kids, though I believe that being raised with boys is the best way of growing up! I am very
                close with my siblings and believe that Family is everything. I wouldn't have my family any other way<br>
                <br>
                At a very young age I started to take Ballet and began to perform across the country. I would go in with a group of other Dancers and teach at conferences.
                I had a blast! I was out of the state at least once a month and met some super cool people. Due of the demand of the dance schedule I had 
                My mom decided that she wanted to homeschool me and pulled me out when I was in 6th grade but  
                because I that I was able to Travel, teach, and graduate early, though I would have liked to have had the "high school" experience. <br>

                <br> My work life isn't as axciting as teaching and traveling, but while I was in college for business administration I was a manager at Panera working 60+
                hours a week. I was exausted all the time trying to keep up with work, school, and dance which still had a demand. I left school because I didn't really feel the passion 
                for business administration. I was woking at Panera and dancing with all my attention. After 9 years of working tirelessly I decided I needed a change of paste,
                I ended up getting a job at Wells Fargo bank as a personal banker. While i do like my job and it does pay the bills, I have been working there for 5 years now and 
                feel like it's time for me to look into doing something different. That's when one of my Mom's friend's told me about a coding class and I was like "why not"?<br>
                <br>
                With all that being said I still do dance but it is not as predominately in my life as it was before. My current hobbies are mountain bike riding
                and riding my motorcycle. I am also a nerd at heart, I love all things Science Fiction and have my house decorated in Star Wars/ star Trek figurines.
                I grew up watching StarGate and babylon 5. I also have 2 dogs (one named Anikan) and they are the loves of my life!
