          <p>Their really isn't much to know about me. I was born and raised in Ocala,Fl where I currently reside.
            I am the only girl of 4 kids, though I believe that being raised with boys is the best way of growing up! I
            am very
            close with my siblings and believe that Family is everything. I wouldn't have my family any other way<br>
            <br>
            At a very young age I started to take Ballet and began to perform across the country. I would go in with a
            group of other Dancers and teach at conferences.
            I had a blast! I was out of the state at least once a month and met some super cool people. Due to the
            demand of my dance schedule,
            My mom decided that she wanted to homeschool me and pulled me out when I was in 6th grade.
            Because of that I was able to travel, teach, and graduate early, though I would have liked to have had the
            "high school" experience. <br>

            <br> My work life isn't as axciting as teaching and traveling. I worked as a manager at Panera Bread and was
            working 60+ hours
            hours a week. I was exausted all the time trying to keep up with work, school, and dance which still had a
            demand. I left school because I didn't really feel passion
            for business administration. After 9 years of working tirelessly I decided I needed a change of paste,
            I ended up getting a job at Wells Fargo bank as a personal banker. While I do like my job and it does pay
            the bills, I have been working there for 5 years now and
            feel like it's time for me to look into doing something different. That's when one of my Mom's friend's told
            me about a coding class and I was like "why not"?<br>
            <br>
            With all that being said I still do dance but it is not as predominately in my life as it was before. My
            current hobbies are mountain bike riding
            and riding my motorcycle. I am also a nerd at heart, I love all things Science Fiction and have my house
            decorated in Star Wars/ star Trek figurines.
            I grew up watching StarGate and babylon 5. I also have 2 dogs (one named Anikan) and they are the loves of
            my life!
